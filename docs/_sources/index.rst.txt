TaskBeacon
----------

Welcome to **TaskBeacon**, a community-driven platform for sharing, standardizing, and enhancing psychological paradigms.  
Our mission is to improve **reproducibility and efficiency** in psychological and brain science research through structured formats and LLM-powered experiment generation.

TaskBeacon is an open science initiative that offers a suite of tools and resources:

- `TAPS <https://taskbeacon.github.io/taps>`_ – A standardized format for structuring cognitive tasks 
- `psyflow <https://taskbeacon.github.io/psyflow/>`_ – A Python library for programming cognitive experiments 
- `Task Library <https://taskbeacon.github.io/task_index/>`_ – A curated collection of well-documented experimental templates 

TAPS and psyflow make cross-cultural localization efficient by separating task logic from language-specific content and configuration.  
This modular structure allows researchers to easily adapt paradigms across different languages and cultural contexts without rewriting core code, fostering global accessibility and collaboration.

We are continuously expanding the platform to support more automation, customization, and community collaboration. `Learn more about future directions <https://taskbeacon.github.io/future_directions>`_
