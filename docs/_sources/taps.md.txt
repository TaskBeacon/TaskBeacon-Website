The Task Archive and Protocol Specification (TAPS) defines a consistent format for describing cognitive tasks. By capturing stimuli, procedures and timing, TAPS makes tasks reproducible and easier to share.

Researchers can write tasks once and deploy them across different platforms without manual rewriting.
