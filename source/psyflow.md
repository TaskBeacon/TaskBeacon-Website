# PsyFlow

PsyFlow is a Python framework designed for building cognitive experiments. It integrates seamlessly with TAPS task descriptions and handles participant flow, data collection and timing.

The framework reduces boilerplate code so researchers can focus on designing experiments rather than infrastructure.
