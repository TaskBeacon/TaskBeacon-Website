TaskBeacon – Advancing Reproducible Psychological Paradigms
===========================================================

Welcome to **TaskBeacon**, a community-driven platform dedicated to **sharing, standardizing, and enhancing psychological paradigms**.  
Our mission is to improve **reproducibility and efficiency** in psychological and brain science research through structured formats and **LLM-powered experiment generation**.

What is TaskBeacon?
-------------------

TaskBeacon is an open science initiative that offers:

**Standardized Paradigm Format – TAPS**  
- We develop **TAPS (Task and Paradigm Structure)**, a **structured, reproducible format** for psychological paradigms.  
- It ensures **clarity, consistency**, and **high reproducibility** in experimental designs.
- Learn  more about TAPS: `TAPS Documentation <https://taskbeacon.github.io/taps/>`_


**Open-Source Psychological Task Library**  
- A curated repository of well-documented experiment templates, including:
  - Cognitive tasks (e.g., Go/No-Go, Stroop, N-Back)  
  - Reaction-time studies  
  - EEG, fMRI, eye-tracking, and fNIRS paradigms  
  - Clinical and behavioral experiments  
  - Learn more about the tasks we are sharing: `Tasks <https://taskbeacon.github.io/task_index/>`_

**Cross-Cultural Adaptation of Psychological Tasks**  
- Supports **automatic localization** into multiple languages  
- Promotes **global collaboration and accessibility** in research

**Future Directions**  
- Leverages **large language models (LLMs)** to automate and streamline paradigm creation.  
- Reduces setup time while ensuring robust and reproducible designs.
